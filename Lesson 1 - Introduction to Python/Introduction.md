# Python: An Introduction.

Designed by Guido van Rossum, Python is a popular open source programming language released in 1991. It is a  general-purpose, high-level programming language maintained by the Python Software Foundation. 

Before you head forward, it is important to note that there are two major Python versions- Python 2 and Python 3. Both the versions have significant differences. 


## Why Learn Python:



*   Simple to Learn
*   Free & open source
*   High-level
*   Emphasizes code readability
*   Interpreted
*   Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on value assigned, it takes data type)
*   Object-oriented language
*   Large Community Support
*   Portable across Operating systems
*   And many other reasons you will discover yourself while learning it. 



## Downloading and Installing Python:

1. Installing Python on Windows
   
   *   Step 1: Download Python Installer
       *   Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
       *   The website will automatically detect your operating system and suggest the latest version of Python for Windows.
       *   Click Download Python 3.x.x (the latest version at the time).
   
   *   Step 2: Run the Python Installer
       *   Once the installer has been downloaded, locate the .exe file in your Downloads folder and double-click it to launch the installer.
    
   *   Step 3: Customize Installation Options
       *   Important: At the bottom of the installation window, check the box that says Add Python to PATH. This step ensures you can use Python from the command line or terminal.
   *   Click Customize installation to proceed to the next step.
   
   *   Step 4: Select Optional Features
       *   In the Optional Features screen, you can leave the default selections (such as:
           *   Documentation: Provides access to Python documentation.
           *   pip: Python’s package manager (important for installing additional packages).
           *   tcl/tk and IDLE: Used for GUI applications and the IDLE development environment.
           *   Python test suite: This is optional for testing Python itself.
       *   Click Next.
   
   *   Step 5: Advanced Options
       *   In the Advanced Options screen, you can leave most of the default options checked. You may want to check the following based on your preferences:
           *   Install for all users: Choose this if you want Python installed system-wide.
           *   Precompile standard library: This helps Python run faster.
       *   Choose an installation location if needed (or leave it as default) and click Install.
  
   *   Step 6: Wait for the Installation to Complete
       *   The installer will begin copying files and setting up Python on your system. Once it’s done, you’ll see a success message. Click Close to exit the installer.
  
   *   Step 7: Verify Python Installation
       *   Open the Command Prompt by pressing Win + R, typing cmd, and pressing Enter.
       *   In the Command Prompt, type:
           *   python --version
       *   This should display the installed Python version (e.g., Python 3.x.x). If it doesn't, check that Python was added to the PATH correctly.

   *   Step 8: Verify pip Installation
       *   In the Command Prompt, type:
           *   pip --version
       *   You should see the version of pip that is installed with Python.

2. Installing Python on macOS
   *   Step 1: Check Pre-installed Python Version (Optional)
       *   macOS comes with Python 2.x pre-installed. To check which version is installed, open Terminal (press Cmd + Space, type Terminal, and press Enter), and type:
           *   python --version
       *   This will likely show Python 2.x.

   *   Step 2: Download Python Installer
       *   Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
       *   The website will detect your operating system and show the latest version for macOS. Click Download Python 3.x.x.
    
   *   Step 3: Install Python
       *   Locate the .pkg file in your Downloads folder and double-click it to launch the installer.
       *   Follow the on-screen instructions:
           *   Click Continue when the installer window opens.
           *   Agree to the License Agreement.
           *   Select the disk where you want to install Python, and click Install.
      
   *   Step 4: Complete Installation
       *   installer will copy files to your system. Once it's finished, click Close.
    
   *   Step 5: Verify Python Installation
       *   Open Terminal and type:
           *   python3 --version
       *   You should see the installed version of Python 3.

   *   Step 6: Verify pip Installation
       *   In the Terminal, type:
           *   pip3 --version
       *   If pip was installed correctly, it should display the version.

3. Installing Python on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)
   *   Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed, but it might be an older version (usually Python 2). Here’s how to install Python 3.x.

   *   Step 1: Update the Package List
       *   Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T on most Linux systems), and update your package manager:
           *   sudo apt update
    
   *   Step 2: Install Python 3
       *   Install Python 3 by running the following command:
       *   sudo apt install python3
      
   *   Step 3: Verify Python Installation
       *   Once the installation is complete, verify that Python is installed:
           *   python3 --version
       *   This should display the installed version of Python 3.

   *   Step 4: Install pip
       *   To install pip (Python’s package manager), use the following command:
       *   sudo apt install python3-pip
      
   *   Step 5: Verify pip Installation
       *   Check if pip is installed correctly:
           *   pip3 --version
      
4. Installing Python on Other Linux Distros (Fedora, Arch, etc.)
   *   Here are commands for other popular Linux distros:

   *   For Fedora:
       *   sudo dnf install python3
    
   *   For Arch Linux:
       *   sudo pacman -S python
  
   *   Once installed, you can verify Python and pip installations with:
       *   python3 --version
       *   pip3 --version
